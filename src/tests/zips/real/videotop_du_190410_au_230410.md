# videotop_du_190410_au_230410.zip Error Breakdown

This zip file, as well as any others in this folder, are examples of 'real-world' zip files that failed in some way. This breakdown exists to document the problem, cause, and ultimately the solution to each failure.

## Problem

This issue was very similar to `Zip_tie_organizer_2891180.zip`. It was essentially doing the same thing, where it failed to decompress.

## The Cause

Similarly to `Zip_tie_organizer_2891180.zip`, this was also because the file metadata was incorrect. This time, however, it was because the file name was being cutoff.

## The Fix

I added a new check that makes sure the expected length for the file name matches the length of the file name
