# الوزراء والكتاب - الجهشياري zip كتاب 367p Error Breakdown

This zip file, as well as any others in this folder, are examples of 'real-world' zip files that failed in some way. This breakdown exists to document the problem, cause, and ultimately the solution to each failure.

## Problem

This zip file was hanging forever on the file header stage and never emitting anything

## The Cause

Because of the Arabic characters used in the file titles, the check to see if the file name was complete was failing. This was because the stringified version didn't match correctly when manually encoded to utf-8.

## The Fix

Instead of parsing the file name as a string, we now first parse it as a buffer directly. We compare the expected length to the length of that buffer, then convert it to a string `fileName`.
